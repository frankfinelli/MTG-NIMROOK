Partner (You can have two commanders if both have partner.)""","0","Chris Rallis","""• You create just one Spirit token, not one for each +1/+1 counter that was on the creature that died.
• If a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies at the same time as Alharu, Alharu’s ability triggers for that creature.
• If Alharu has a +1/+1 counter on it and dies, its ability triggers for itself.
• If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders’ combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
• Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
• To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn’t cause either to cease to be your commander.
• Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won’t have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
• If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
• An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
• You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you’ve cast each from the command zone clear for “commander tax” purposes.""","514330","548","","2023-May-14_06:09:29","USD","5451","Commander Legends","(CMR)","(cmr)","CMR","[CMR]","[cmr]","CMR","cmr","","0","","Regular","Not Using","Have","","","Commander legends 1/30/23","0","502698","4","$0.50","$2.00","4","4x","","58ee8919-65f7-475c-972a-36d9c8d063fc","227151","","0"

• Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.

• Due to a recent rules change to cascade, not only do you stop exiling cards if you exile a nonland card with lesser mana value than the spell with cascade, but the resulting spell you cast must also have lesser mana value.

Once you announce that you’re activating it, no player may take actions until you’ve finished. They can’t try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
• Opponents who have left the game aren’t counted when determining how many tokens to create.
• The tokens copy only what’s on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won’t be copied.
• Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
• If one of the tokens can’t attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having it attack, you aren’t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t have to attack in that case either.
• If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don’t have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.
• If one of the tokens somehow is under another player’s control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can’t sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.""","513965","104","","2023-Feb-02_00:08:06","USD","2467","Commander Legends","(CMR)","(cmr)","CMR","[CMR]","[cmr]","CMR","cmr","","0","","Regular","Not Using","Have","","","Commander legends 1/30/23","0","497624","8","$0.15","$1.20","8","8x","","c3b74135-b8db-4485-a4b1-7aaa3ef28072","227225","","0"
